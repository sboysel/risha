# Risha

Risha is an ultra-compact, wired split ortholinear keyboard featuring:

- **36 keys**
- **Diodeless, reversible PCB** (under 102mm x 102mm)
- **Waveshare RP2040-Zero** (cutout for flush mounting)
- **Rear-facing TRRS connection**

This design prioritizes affordability, simplicity, and ease of assembly. With a total cost of around **$40 AUD**, it's an excellent choice for a budget-friendly custom keyboard.

## Features

- **Fully split layout** with only 36 keys
- **No diodes required** for a simpler build process
- **Reversible PCB** (same PCB can be used for both halves)
- **Compact design** for travel and portability
- **RP2040-Zero powered**, enabling powerful firmware support with KMK
- **TRRS interconnection** between the halves
